DETAILS

This is an empty placeholder file.

The Git and GitHub version control system will always ignore empty folders and
will exclude them from the version control repository.

With website development it is important to maintain the correct folder 
structure and the inclusion of empty folders within that structure is
necessary.

The purpose of this file is to force Git and GitHub to include folders that 
would otherwise be empty and thus not included in the repository.

There is a somewhat unofficial convention within the Git community that 
such files are called .gitkeep.
